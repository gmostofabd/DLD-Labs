        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              The combinational circuit does not use any memory. Hence the previous state of input 
              does not have any effect on the present state of the circuit. But sequential circuit 
              has memory so output can vary based on input. This type of circuits uses previous 
              input, output, clock and a memory element.<br><br>
              
              In this tutorial we will implement a sequential logic circuit called J K Flip Flop.

        <h3>Brief Theory</h3>

        <p>
          Unlike Combinational Logic circuits that change state depending upon the actual signals 
          being applied to their inputs at that time, Sequential Logic circuits have some form of 
          inherent “Memory” built in.<br><br>

          This means that sequential logic circuits are able to take into account their previous 
          input state as well as those actually present, a sort of “before” and “after” effect is 
          involved with sequential circuits.<br><br>

          In other words, the output state of a “sequential logic circuit” is a function of the 
          following three states, the “present input”, the “past input” and/or the “past output”. 
          Sequential Logic circuits remember these conditions and stay fixed in their current 
          state until the next clock signal changes one of the states, giving sequential 
          logic circuits “Memory”. <br><br>

          Sequential logic circuits are generally termed as two state or Bistable devices which 
          can have their output or outputs set in one of two basic states, a logic level “1” or 
          a logic level “0” and will remain “latched” (hence the name latch) indefinitely in 
          this current state or condition until some other input trigger pulse or signal is 
          applied which will cause the bistable to change its state once again.

          
        </p>

        <h4>Sequential Logic Representation</h4>

        <div class="box_50"><img src="images/seq4.gif" alt="seq_ckt"></div>

        <p>
          The word “Sequential” means that things happen in a “sequence”, one after another 
          and in Sequential Logic circuits, the actual clock signal determines when things 
          will happen next. Simple sequential logic circuits can be constructed from standard 
          Bistable circuits such as: Flip-flops, Latches and Counters and which themselves 
          can be made by simply connecting together universal NAND Gates and/or NOR Gates 
          in a particular combinational way to produce the required sequential circuit.
        </p>


        <h3>Classification of Sequential Logic</h3>

        <div class="box_50"><img src="images/sequential-seq3.gif" alt="seqtype"></div>


        <p>
          As well as the two logic states mentioned above logic level “1” and logic level “0”, 
          a third element is introduced that separates sequential logic circuits from their 
          combinational logic counterparts, namely TIME. Sequential logic circuits return back 
          to their original steady state once reset and sequential circuits with loops or 
          feedback paths are said to be “cyclic” in nature. <br><br>

          We now know that in sequential circuits changes occur only on the application of a 
          clock signal making it synchronous, otherwise the circuit is asynchronous and depends 
          upon an external input. To retain their current state, sequential circuits rely on 
          feedback and this occurs when a fraction of the output is fed back to the input and 
          this is demonstrated as:
        </p>

        <h3>Sequential Feedback Loop</h3>

        <div class="box_70"><img src="images/sequential-seq31.gif" alt="feedback"></div>


        <p>
          The two inverters or NOT gates are connected in series with the output at Q fed 
          back to the input. Unfortunately, this configuration never changes state because 
          the output will always be the same, either a “1” or a “0”, it is permanently set. 
          However, we can see how feedback works by examining the most basic sequential 
          logic components, called the SR flip-flop. <br><br>

          The basic S-R NAND flip-flop circuit has many advantages and uses in sequential 
          logic circuits but it suffers from two basic switching problems. <br><br>

          1. the Set = 0 and Reset = 0 condition (S = R = 0) must always be avoided <br><br>
          2. if Set or Reset change state while the enable (EN) input is high the 
          correct latching action may not occur <br><br>

          Then to overcome these two fundamental design problems with the SR flip-flop design, 
          the JK flip Flop was developed.
        </p>





      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>J K Flip Flop</h3>
        <p>
          This simple JK flip Flop is the most widely used of all the flip-flop designs and is 
          considered to be a universal flip-flop circuit. The two inputs labelled “J” and “K” 
          are not shortened abbreviated letters of other words, such as “S” for Set and “R” 
          for Reset, but are themselves autonomous letters chosen by its inventor Jack Kilby 
          to distinguish the flip-flop design from other types.<br><br>

          The sequential operation of the JK flip flop is exactly the same as for the previous 
          SR flip-flop with the same “Set” and “Reset” inputs. The difference this time is that 
          the “JK flip flop” has no invalid or forbidden input states of the SR Latch even when 
          S and R are both at logic “1”.<br><br>

          The JK flip flop is basically a gated SR flip-flop with the addition of a clock input 
          circuitry that prevents the illegal or invalid output condition that can occur when 
          both inputs S and R are equal to logic level “1”. Due to this additional clocked 
          input, a JK flip-flop has four possible input combinations, “logic 1”, “logic 0”, 
          “no change” and “toggle”. The symbol for a JK flip flop is similar to that of an 
          SR Bistable Latch as seen in the previous tutorial except for the addition of a 
          clock input.<br><br>
   
        </p>


        <h3>The Basic JK Flip-flop</h3>


        <div class="box_90"><img src="images/sequential-seq13.gif" alt="jkff"></div>

        <p>
          Both the S and the R inputs of the previous SR bistable have now been replaced by two 
          inputs called the J and K inputs, respectively after its inventor Jack Kilby. Then 
          this equates to: J = S and K = R. <br><br>

          The two 2-input AND gates of the gated SR bistable have now been replaced by two 
          3-input NAND gates with the third input of each gate connected to the outputs at 
          Q and Q. This cross coupling of the SR flip-flop allows the previously invalid 
          condition of S = “1” and R = “1” state to be used to produce a “toggle action” 
          as the two inputs are now interlocked. <br><br>

          If the circuit is now “SET” the J input is inhibited by the “0” status of Q through 
          the lower NAND gate. If the circuit is “RESET” the K input is inhibited by the “0” 
          status of Q through the upper NAND gate. As Q and Q are always different we can use 
          them to control the input. When both inputs J and K are equal to logic “1”, the JK 
          flip flop toggles as shown in the following truth table. <br><br>       
        </p>

        <h3>The Truth Table for the JK Function</h3>

        <div class="box_70"><img src="images/jk_truth_table.png" alt="jk_tt"></div>
        

        <p>
          Then the JK flip-flop is basically an SR flip flop with feedback which enables only 
          one of its two input terminals, either SET or RESET to be active at any one time 
          under normal switching thereby eliminating the invalid condition seen previously 
          in the SR flip flop circuit. <br> <br>

          However, if both the J and K inputs are HIGH at logic “1” (J = K = 1), when the clock 
          input goes HIGH, the circuit will “toggle” as its outputs switch and change state 
          complementing each other. This results in the JK flip-flop acting more like a T-type 
          toggle flip-flop when both terminals are “HIGH”. However, as the outputs are fed back 
          to the inputs, this can cause the output at Q to oscillate between SET and RESET 
          continuously after being complemented once. <br> <br>

          While this JK flip-flop circuit is an improvement on the clocked SR flip-flop it also 
          suffers from timing problems called “race” if the output Q changes state before the 
          timing pulse of the clock input has time to go “OFF”. To avoid this the timing pulse 
          period ( T ) must be kept as short as possible (high frequency). As this is sometimes 
          not possible with basic JK flip-flops built using basic NAND or NOR gates, far more 
          advanced master-slave (edge-triggered) flip-flops were developed which are more stable.
        </p>

        <h3>Master-Slave JK Flip-flop</h3>

        <p>
          The master-slave flip-flop eliminates all the timing problems by using two SR flip-flops 
          connected together in a series configuration. One flip-flop acts as the “Master” circuit, 
          which triggers on the leading edge of the clock pulse while the other acts as the “Slave” 
          circuit, which triggers on the falling edge of the clock pulse. This results in the two 
          sections, the master section and the slave section being enabled during opposite half-cycles 
          of the clock signal. <br><br>

          The TTL 74LS73 is a Dual JK flip-flop IC, which contains two individual JK type bistable’s 
          within a single chip enabling single or master-slave toggle flip-flops to be made. Other JK 
          flip flop IC’s include the 74LS107 Dual JK flip-flop with clear, the 74LS109 Dual positive-edge 
          triggered JK flip flop and the 74LS112 Dual negative-edge triggered flip-flop with both preset 
          and clear inputs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Master-Slave Flip-Flop is basically two gated SR flip-flops connected together in a 
          series configuration with the slave having an inverted clock pulse. The outputs from 
          Q and Q from the “Slave” flip-flop are fed back to the inputs of the “Master” with the 
          outputs of the “Master” flip flop being connected to the two inputs of the “Slave” flip 
          flop. This feedback configuration from the slave’s output to the master’s input gives 
          the characteristic toggle of the JK flip flop as shown below.
        </p>

        <h3>The Master-Slave JK Flip Flop</h3>
        <p>
          The input signals J and K are connected to the gated “master” SR flip flop which “locks” 
          the input condition while the clock (Clk) input is “HIGH” at logic level “1”. As the clock 
          input of the “slave” flip flop is the inverse (complement) of the “master” clock input, 
          the “slave” SR flip flop does not toggle. The outputs from the “master” flip flop are 
          only “seen” by the gated “slave” flip flop when the clock input goes “LOW” to logic level “0”. <br><br>

          When the clock is “LOW”, the outputs from the “master” flip flop are latched and any 
          additional changes to its inputs are ignored. The gated “slave” flip flop now responds to 
          the state of its inputs passed over by the “master” section. <br><br>

          Then on the “Low-to-High” transition of the clock pulse the inputs of the “master” flip flop 
          are fed through to the gated inputs of the “slave” flip flop and on the “High-to-Low” transition 
          the same inputs are reflected on the output of the “slave” making this type of flip flop edge 
          or pulse-triggered. <br><br>

          Then, the circuit accepts input data when the clock signal is “HIGH”, and passes the data to 
          the output on the falling-edge of the clock signal. In other words, the Master-Slave JK Flip 
          flop is a “Synchronous” device as it only passes data with the timing of the clock signal. <br><br>

          In the next tutorial about Sequential Logic Circuits, we will look at Multivibrators that are 
          used as waveform generators to produce the clock signals to switch sequential circuits.
